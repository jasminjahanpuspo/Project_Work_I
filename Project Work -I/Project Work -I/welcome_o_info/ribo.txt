RIBO is a Bengali speaking social humanoid robot that can speak, interact with humans, make facial gestures, handshake and dance. It is being developed by a group- RoboSUST, formed with students from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology.

The robot right now as it is, RIBO v1.0 has only movements in the upper torso. The RIBO team plans to develop the robot further and give it proper movements in the legs, so that RIBO can be more socially interact with mass population and aid them in need.
