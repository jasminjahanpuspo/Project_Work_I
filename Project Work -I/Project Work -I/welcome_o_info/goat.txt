1.The domestic goat or simply goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of C. aegagrus domesticated 
from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the animal family
 Bovidae and the goatâ€”antelope subfamily Caprinae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. 
 There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat.[1] Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species of animal, 
 and have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world.[2] Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese.
