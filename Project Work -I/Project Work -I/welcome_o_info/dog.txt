1.Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. 
They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, 
and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. Today, some dogs are used as pets, 
others are used to help humans do their work.
